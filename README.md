## important

Until I update this more fully, please be aware:

1. This uses [my dev branch of keras](https://github.com/braingineer/keras/tree/dev)
2. It also uses two helper libraries: [baal](https://github.com/braingineer/baal) and [ikelos](https://github.com/braingineer/ikelos)

## short blurb

This work presents two stochastic tree models.  
It evaluates them on supertag classification and string linearization. 

This readme will be completed more in depth, soon.   
Until then, check out scripts or runners.  
They serve as the entry point to the training, the tagging, and the linearization. 

README goals:
- description of each part of the repo.
- instructions on how to run
